<!--
Hello! If you're reading this, you probably had some interest in my profile.
Feel free to use this code and create your own profile!
The only thing I ask is that you leave the link to this repository on your profile.
(And of course, replace the information with yours)

ATTENTION: For this file to work, you need to rename it to "README.md", without the quotes.
Choose between the available language options and rename the file accordingly. For example, if you
want to use English, delete the "en-us.md" file and rename this file to "README.md".
Also, remember to leave the README.md file in the root directory of your profile along with
the assets folder so that GitHub can recognize it.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me on Discord.

<!-- Central Title -->
# Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Yago, a technology enthusiast!

<!-- Introduction text of your profile -->
<!-- Here, I recommend that you make a short text, but enough for people
 to know who you are. Specifically this README.md, I tried to focus more on who I am and
  what I do in a minimally professional and personal way, but do as you prefer -->
Since my first contact with technology through video games, like the iconic PS2, I have passionately explored this fascinating world. I deeply believe in the transformative power of technology to improve people's quality of life. Determined to share my knowledge and acquire new experiences, I am currently studying computer science. My focus is to find my place in this vast and complex universe, aiming to become an exceptional developer. I have a special interest in working as a full-stack, specializing in information security, and, above all, in software development.

<!-- Section for links to social networks or contact -->
<!-- I recommend that you put links to social networks or contacts that you want to share. You can use social media icons or just text, as I did. However, try to use specific social networks for developers, like LinkedIn, or social networks that you use for professional purposes. -->
## How to reach me?

That's it! I hope you enjoyed my profile and managed to create your own profile.
I strongly recommend that you do not copy my code, creating your
own code is a great way to learn and take pride in your work.

This README.md was directly influenced by [arthurspk](https://github.com/arthurspk/arthurspk)'s profile, which helped me create my own profile. If you liked my profile, I recommend you take a look at his profile, it's very good!

But if you insist on using it, no problem, I won't stop you. I just ask that
you leave the link to this repository on your profile, it's the least you can do,
isn't it? ;)
