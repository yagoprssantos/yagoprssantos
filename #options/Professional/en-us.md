<!--
Hello! If you are reading this, you probably have some interest in my profile.
Feel free to use this code and create your own profile!
The only thing I ask is that you leave the link to this repository in your profile.
(And of course, replace the information with your own)

ATTENTION: For this file to work, you need to rename it to "README.md", without the quotes.
Choose from the available language options and rename the file accordingly. For example, if you
want to use Portuguese, delete the "en-us.md" file and rename this file to "README.md".
Also, remember to leave the README.md file in the root directory of your profile along with
the assets folder so that GitHub can recognize it.

If you have any questions, you can contact me on Discord, no problem.

# üë®‚Äçüíª I'm Yago, an Express Developer ‚òïüáßüá∑

<!-- Introduction text for your profile -->
<!-- Here, I recommend that you write a short text, but enough for people to know who you are. Specifically, in this README.md, I tried to focus more on who I am and what I do in a minimally professional and personal way, but do as you prefer -->

Determined to share my knowledge and gain new experiences, I am currently studying Computer Science at UniCEUB. I am passionate about technology and always looking for new challenges. My focus is to find my place in this vast and complex universe, with the goal of becoming an exceptional developer. I have a particular interest in working in the areas of IT Infrastructure, DevOps, Software Development, and Information Security. I love collaborating on innovative projects and believe that knowledge exchange is essential for professional and personal growth.

<!-- Section for social media links or contact -->
<!-- I recommend that you include links to social media or contacts that you want to share. You can use social media icons or just text, as I did. However, try to use social media specific to developers, such as LinkedIn, or social media that you use for professional purposes. -->

## How to contact me?

<!-- My Discord, for example, is a contact method that I use for both professional and personal purposes, so I included it here. -->

Well, that's it! I hope you liked my profile and managed to create your own profile.
I strongly recommend that you do not copy my code; creating your own code is a great way to learn and feel proud of your work.

Specifically, this README.md was directly influenced by the profile of [arthurspk](https://github.com/arthurspk/arthurspk), who helped me create my own profile. If you liked my profile, I recommend you check out his profile, it's very good!

But if you insist on using it, no problem, I won't stop you. I just ask that
you leave the link to this repository in your profile, it's the least you can do, right? ;)
