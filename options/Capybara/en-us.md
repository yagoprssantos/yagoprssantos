<!--
Hello! If you're reading this, you've probably shown some interest in my profile.
Feel free to use this code to create your own profile!
The only thing I ask is that you leave the link to this repository in your profile.
(and replace the information with yours, of course)

ATTENTION: To make this work, you need to change the name of this file to "README.md", without the quotes.
Choose the language you want to use and delete the other file. For example, if you want to use English,
delete the "pt-br.md" file and rename this file to "README.md". And remember to put the README.md file in
the root of your profile with the assets folder so GitHub can recognize it.

If you have any questions, you can contact me on Discord, no problem.

<!-- Centralized Title -->

<!-- Social media or contact links section -->
<!--
Place your social media links here. Change the "href" to the link you want to use
and the "src" to the social media icon you want to use. You can find all the icons
available at https://simpleicons.org/.

<!-- Personal introduction section -->
<!--
Place your personal information here. I recommend writing a short but
informative text so that people know who you are. Be creative!
 -->
<p id="bio"></p>

<!-- Images on the right -->
<!--
Place the images you want to display on the right side of your profile here. You can put
as many images as you want, but I recommend not putting more than 2. You can also
adjust the size of the images, but I recommend not changing the vertical size, as it may
break your profile's layout.

Also, do not use the same images I'm using here. You can find
free images on the internet or create your own (as I did).

  <!-- <img src="assets/laptopLinux.gif" height="180" width="140" align="right"/> -->
  <img src="assets/capybara.gif" height="180" align="right"/>
</div>


<!-- Personal information section -->
<!--
Place your personal information here. You can put as much information as you want,
but I recommend keeping the size of the list proportional to the size of the image
you placed next to this list.

Here, you can include information such as your name, age, location, or, like me,
more personal information such as hobbies, interests, etc.

<!-- Statistics section -->
<!--
Here I created a statistics section for my profile. You can create one too, but
I recommend not copying my code. You can search for other ways to
create a statistics section for your profile.

In case you're wondering, yes, there are other ways to create this same section using tables, but I was too lazy to do that. Simple as that.

If you insist on using it, you can change the statistics theme and the username
to your GitHub username. You can find more themes at
https://github.com/vn7n24fzkq/github-profile-summary-cards

<!--
Well, that's it! I hope you liked my profile and that you managed to create your own profile. I strongly recommend that you don't copy my code; creating your
own code is a great way to learn and take pride in your work.

But if you insist on using it, no problem, I won't stop you. I just ask that
you leave the link to this repository on your profile, it's the least you can do,
right? ;)
